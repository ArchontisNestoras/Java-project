-My first big project
-In this year's project, we developed a program that allows an analyst to apply filters to structured data files (i.e., files with specific fields per record) and visualize the records that meet the criteria. The system registers files, capturing their characteristics, such as path, fields, and a user-friendly name. To handle large files, the analyst can submit filters, which are the conjunction of individual filters. The system returns records that satisfy all filter criteria, and the analyst can request to save the result or display it as a bar chart or line chart. The central idea is to work with structured data files, where each record has specific fields separated by a delimiter. The analyst can register a file, apply filters, retrieve field names, save filtered results, and present results visually. The frontend uses a Map to associate user-friendly filter names with results for further processing, such as visualization. The backend supports individual and composite filters, enabling complex queries on various file fields. The analyst can print results to a specified PrintStream, save results to a file, or present them in a chart. The flexibility of the system empowers analysts to efficiently analyze and visualize structured data.
